<h2 class=title1>about me</h2>
<ul>
	<li>major: cs and asian + middle eastern studies (ames)</li>
	<li>hometown: norman, ok + guangzhou, china</li>
	<li>class: 2019, junior</li>
	<li>hobbies: watching asian dramas, reading manga, watching swimming/diving/tennis/figure skating, traveling, eating good food</li>
</ul>

<h2 class=title2>cs bio</h2>
<ul>
	<li>i was introduced to computers at a very young age, around 7 or so. my mom was getting a new laptop at work, so she retired her old one to me. i mainly used windows computers until freshman year of high school, when my parents bought me a macbook air. i was against switching from windows at first, but i'm so comfortable with using macs now that i'm now on my second macbook.</li>
	<li>my mom is a software engineer, so i've been exposed to the field for a long time. however, i never really thought about majoring in computer science until i came to duke. before college, i thought about studying maybe math or bme with east asian studies. then i took cs 201, which i had a love-hate relationship with, but ultimately decided to major. currently, i'm confused about what exactly i want to do with this degree but mainly just trying to live my best (and least stressful) life. probably either going to work in corporate tech for a few years and then go to medical school in the future.</li>
	<li>50% of the time, i use a computer for entertainment, so like watching tv or youtube. 40% for school work, so coding, writing papers, or googling things. 10% for online shopping and other miscellaneous tasks.</li>
	<li>depending on how one defines "computer scientist," i envision the work to be a combination of programming, algorithms/systems/AI/other research, and teaching.</li>
	<li>i am taking this course because:
	<ol>
		<li>i want to become more proficient in html, css, and javascript.</li>
		<li>i want to become more familiar with how to build web apps.</li>
		<li>i want an excuse to build a personal website.</li>
		<li>i needed a cs elective.</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>not very familiar with building websites (why i'm taking this class), but i assume one needs to understand some combination of ui/ux, how to incorporate databases, and html/css/javascript to build a good website.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class=title3>links</h2>
<ul>
	<li>i like the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com">airbnb website</a> because i like clean and minimalist designs. i also like the <a href="https://www.whowhatwear.com/">who what wear blog</a> for the same reasons: clean and easy to navigate.</li> 
	<li>i don't like <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/">buzzfeed's website</a> because it looks like one of those pop-up ad websites that open when you're on a sketchy website. i should like <a href="https://www.duke.edu/">duke's website</a>, but the fonts and layout are pretty unattractive.</li>
	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction">here</a> is a resource from mozilla on web apis. <a href="http://labs.jensimmons.com/">here</a> is a resource on the latest css properties.</li>
