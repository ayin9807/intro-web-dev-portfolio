<h2>About Me</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Hi! My name is Annie Yin and I am currently a junior (Class of 2019!!) studying CS and Korean at Duke University. I was born in Guangzhou, China but moved to Norman, Oklahoma at the age of 6.</li>
	<li>I was introduced to computers at a very young age, around 7 or so. My mom was getting a new laptop at work, so she retired her old one to me. I mainly used Windows computers until freshman year of high school, when my parents bought me a MacBook Air. I was against switching to the macOS at first, but I am so comfortable with using Macs now that I am on my second MacBook.</li>
	<li>My mom is a software engineer, so I've been exposed to the field for a long time. However, I never really thought about majoring in computer science until I came to Duke. Before college, I thought about studying maybe math or BME with East Asian Studies. Then I took CS 201, which I had a love-hate relationship with, and decided to major. Currently, I'm confused about what exactly I want to do with this degree, but mainly just trying to live my best (and least stressful) life. Probably either going to work in corporate tech or go to medical school in the near future.</li>
	<li>Probably 50% of the time, I use a computer for entertainment, so like watching TV or YouTube. And then 40% for school work, so coding, writing papers, or googling things. The last 10% is used for online shopping.</li>
	<li>Depending on how one defines "computer scientist," I envision the work to be a combination of programming, algorithms/systems/AI/other research, and teaching.</li>
	<li>I am taking this course because:
	<ol>
		<li>I want to become more proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</li>
		<li>I want to become more familiar with how to build web apps.</li>
		<li>I want an excuse to build a personal website.</li>
		<li>I needed an elective.</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>Not very familiar with building websites (why I'm taking this class), but I assume one needs to understand some combination of UI/UX, how to incorporate databases, and HTML/CSS/Javascript.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Links</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I like <a href="https://www.airbnb.com">this website</a> because I like clean and minimalist designs. I also like <a href="https://www.whowhatwear.com/">this website</a> for the same reasons: clean and easy to navigate.</li> 
	<li>I don't like <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/">this website</a> because it looks like one of those pop-up ad websites that open when you're on a sketchy website. I should like <a href="https://www.duke.edu/">this website</a>, but I don't because it looks ugly.</li>
	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction">Here</a> is a resource on web APIs. <a href="http://labs.jensimmons.com/">Here</a> is a resource on the latest CSS properties.</li>
