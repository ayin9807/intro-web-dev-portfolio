    - Carolyn Sun
- Resources used:
    - Vue documentation (https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
    - example_firebase repository (mainly for help on getting image inputs)
    - Firebase documentation (https://firebase.google.com/docs/) 
    - Stackoverflow for how to get values in Firebase (essentially taking learning to take snapshots) and how to stop event propagation.
    - How to use Promises with Firebase from Firebase blog (https://firebase.googleblog.com/2016/01/keeping-our-promises-and-callbacks_76.html)
- Assets:
    - Clock icon (in *images* folder) from IcoMoon Free (https://icomoon.io/)
    - Other icons from FontAwesome (https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)
    - All pics in Firebase are mine.
- Bugs/concerns: 
	- Probably a lot, but I think everything I implemented works to a certain extent.
- Other comments: 
	- Two extra features: adding users to card and adding comments
	- For some reason, I interpreted adding users to cards as you have to be logged in yourself and add yourself to the card instead of adding other users to the card. I hope that's okay? I know that at the very least an user should be logged in in order to add users. 
	- I know technically multiple users can be logged in at the same time, but I implemented it as only one person can be logged at the same time given the scope of this app, users can't see different versions of the webpage.
	- Can only add comments when you are logged in.
	- What the icons on the cards mean:
		- Times/x = delete card
		- Arrows-alt = move card to different list
		- Plus = add current logged-in user to card 
		- Angle up/down for list = collapse/expand list
		- Angle left/right for list = move list
		- Angle up/down for comment = move card in list
	- To change name of list/card, just click on the names themselves.
	- To filter by category, click on the category divs and click again to show all cards.
	- The cards with images take some time to load.
